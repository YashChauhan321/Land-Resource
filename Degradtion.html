        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Land degradation is a process in which the value of the biophysical environment is affected by a combination of human-induced processes acting upon the land. It is viewed as any change or disturbance to the land perceived to be deleterious or undesirable. Natural hazards are excluded as a cause; however human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods and bush fires.

          Expert projections suggest that land degradation will be an important theme of the 21st century, impacting agricultural productivity, biodiversity loss, environmental change, and its effects on food security. It is estimated that up to 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Rainfall meets land at the soil surface.Rainfall is divided over several pedohydrological components. Green water is that part of rainfall that is stored in the soil and available to plants. Land degradation decreases infiltration, waterholding capacity and transpiration, but enhances runoff and soil evaporation</p><p>	
          Wind is considered as a major climatic factor affecting soil erosion in dry lands, causing severe problems of atmospheric drought and damage to the growing plants.Strong winds blowing during summer favour extensive fires along the Mediterranean, afterwards causing severe problems of erosion and land degradation</p>
          <p>
            A landslide is often viewed as an example of land degradation in action – it changes the features of the land, causes destruction of houses, and disrupts activities. In the longer term, however, the area of a landslide may regain its productivity.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"><strong>Afforestation</strong> is growing more new plants and trees and preventing the destruction of already existing forests. For the whole country, 20%-25% of forest land was considered enough for soil and water conservation. But it was then raised to 33%. The best way of conserving soil and water is to grow as many plants and trees as possible as they hold the soil and absorb water.</p><p><strong>Construction of Dams:</strong> Much soil erosion happens due to river floods. This can be prevented by constructing dams across the river. This way we can check the speed of water and prevent soil erosion.</p><p><strong>Planting of shelters of plants or windbreaks:</strong> In coastal regions trees are planted to check the wind movement. One or two rows of trees or shrubs are planted to prevent soil erosion by wind. This is a way of protecting soil from wind.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Desertification is a phenomenon that ranks among the greatest environmental challenges of our time.

          Although desertification can include the encroachment of sand dunes on land, it doesn’t refer to the advance of deserts. Rather, it is the persistent degradation of dryland ecosystems by climate change and mainly human activities: unsustainable farming that depletes the nutrients in the soil, mining, overgrazing (animals eat away grasses and erode topsoil with their hooves) and clear-cutting of land, when the tree and plant cover that binds the soil is removed. It occurs when trees and bushes are stripped away for fuelwood and timber, or to clear land for cultivation.<h1><U><a href="Desertification.html">Read more on the next page</a></h1></U></p>
