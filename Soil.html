        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Soil, also commonly referred to as earth or dirt, is a mixture of organic matter, minerals, gases, liquids, and organisms that together support the life of plants and soil organisms. Some scientific definitions distinguish dirt from soil by restricting the former term specifically to displaced soil.

          Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution). Soil is a product of several factors: the influence of climate, relief (elevation, orientation, and slope of terrain), organisms, and the soil's parent materials (original minerals) interacting over time. It continually undergoes development by way of numerous physical, chemical and biological processes, which include weathering with associated erosion.Given its complexity and strong internal connectedness, soil ecologists regard soil as an ecosystem.</p>

        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Soil formation, also known as pedogenesis, is the process of soil genesis as regulated by the effects of place, environment, and history. Biogeochemical processes act to both create and destroy order (anisotropy) within soils. These alterations lead to the development of layers, termed soil horizons, distinguished by differences in color, structure, texture, and chemistry. These features occur in patterns of soil type distribution, forming in response to differences in soil forming factors.

          Pedogenesis is studied as a branch of pedology, the study of soil in its natural environment. Other branches of pedology are the study of soil morphology, and soil classification. The study of pedogenesis is important to understanding soil distribution patterns in current (soil geography) and past (paleopedology) geologic periods.Soils develop from parent material by various weathering processes. Organic matter accumulation, decomposition, and humification are as critically important to soil formation as weathering. The zone of humification and weathering where pedogenic processes are dominant and where biota play an important role is termed the solum.

        </h1>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The soil profile is an important tool in nutrient management. By examining a soil profile, we can gain valuable insight into soil fertility. As the soil weathers and/or organic matter decomposes, the profile of the soil changes. For instance, a highly weathered, infertile soil usually contains a light-colored layer in the subsurface soil from which nutrients have leached away. On the other hand, a highly fertile soil often has a deep surface layer that contains high amounts of organic matter. With clues provided by soil profile, we can begin to predict how a soil will perform under certain nutrient management conditions.A soil horizon makes up a distinct layer of soil. The horizon runs roughly parallel to the soil surface and has different properties and characteristics than the adjacent layers above and below. The soil profile is a vertical section of the soil that depicts all of its horizons. The soil profile extends from the soil surface to the parent rock material.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Soil is teeming with life. There are more living organisms in a handful of soil than there are people on the planet.
          Soil provides a host of crucial services for both people and the planet. Soil puts food on our plates, purifies our water, protects us against flooding and combats drought. It’s also key to tackling climate change as it captures and stores vast amounts of carbon.
          There is no food security without healthy soils. Agriculture is the only essential industry but farming has one of the biggest impacts on soil health. Intensive farming eliminates species living within the soil – species that give soil its fertility. How we farm today is destroying our ability to feed the planet in the future.
          Creating new soil takes longer than the average human life. We need to protect and conserve soil – it is a living resource and it is finite.Healthy soils are essential for healthy plant growth, human nutrition, and water filtration. Healthy soil supports a landscape that is more resilient to the impacts of drought, flood, or fire.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Land degradation maps were generated and are useful for planning soil conservation / reclamation programs, land use planning, for bringing additional areas into cultivation and also to improve productivity levels in degraded lands. Maps of salt affected and water logging area, soil erosion maps are provide in bhuvan portal.
 
        Studies were carried out to prepare soil maps at 1:25,000 and 1:12,500 scales in selected districts in the country. Several studies are carried out on pilot scale for preparation of soil maps at 1:10K scale required for Village level management of soils, delineation of homogeneous management zones for macro nutrient management, precision Agriculture in mono cropped agricultural systems Studies on Soil Carbon Dynamics was carried out  as part of  National Carbon Project which also provided key inputs to UNCCD towards  national land neutrality targets.<h1><U><a href="Desertification.html">Read more on the next page</a></h1></U></p>
